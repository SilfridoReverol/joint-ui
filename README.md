<h1>login and register pages</h1>
do receive the auth token but don't redirect to home after getting it

@todo - setup a reducer to manage login and register actions to redirect to home with redux-react
after that
[
- create post form to create posts
- create profile form to create & update profile
- show posts on home
- change the tabs from home.tsx to a component called homeTabs.tsx
- create searchbar to look for people
]
